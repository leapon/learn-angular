7 Minute Workout
================

7 Minute Workout is an exercise/workout plan that requires us to perform
a set of twelve exercises in quick succession within the seven minute time span.

Everything in AngularJS can be categorized into four buckets namely:

  controllers
  directives
  filters
  services

Services are singleton in nature so they also provide a mechanism for
sharing data across these constructs.

Filters in Angular are used to transform model data from one format to another.
Filters are mostly used in combination with views.
